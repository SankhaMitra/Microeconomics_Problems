# Microeconomics_Problems
This repository contains python codes for solving some basic microeconomic theory problems that we all study at our undergraduate levels. One of the coding tasks undertaken by me when I started learning python.   

Kindly note that if you download and read the html file, it would not let you try the interactive tasks. The codes and output of last run would be displayed. You can use the codes to solve a similar problem in an interactive way. 

The jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) would let you run the interactive tasks.
